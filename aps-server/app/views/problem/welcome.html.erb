<h2>How to submit proofs.</h2>
<p>
Open problem page.  There are some code fragments (Definitions, Theorem and Verify).
</p>

<p>
Some problem contains 'Definitions' part.  In this case, save as 'Definitions.v' and compile it.
</p>
<pre>
$ coqc Definitions.v
</pre>

<p>
Next, save 'Theorem' as 'Theorem.v'.  This part has theorems not proved yet.  Complete proof.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you have proved it, post your 'Theorem.v'.
</p>

<h2>How to create a new problem</h2>
<p>
First, feel free to create a new problem.  Any problem is welcomed.
</p>

<p>
Download problem checker from <%= link_to h('here'), '/aps/problem_checker.tgz' %>.
</p>

<p>
Create files named 'Definitions.v', 'Theorem.v' and 'Verify.v'.  'Definitions.v' is optional.
Please consult the problems already posted.
</p>

<p>
Run checker program.  If 'success' is displayed, you can post it.
If your problem requires some axioms, edit the checker output and copy it to 'Assumption' field.
